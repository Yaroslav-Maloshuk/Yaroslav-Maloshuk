🚀 Full-Stack Python & Data Engineer | FastAPI, React, Scrapy & Node.js<br>
I build fast, scalable, and crash-proof web applications and intelligent data pipelines.<br>
As a Full Stack Python Developer with a professional background in QA Automation, I don't just write code that "works"—I write code that lasts. I specialize in building high-performance backends using FastAPI/Django, complex data scraping systems with Scrapy/Selenium, and modern, responsive frontends using React.js & TailwindCSS.<br>
If you need a complex SaaS MVP, a real-time analytics dashboard, or a system to scrape hard-to-get data—I am your guy.<br>
💎 Why clients choose me:<br>
    The "QA Mindset": My background in testing means fewer bugs in production. I write clean code covered by Pytest, so you don't waste budget on endless fixes.<br>
    Data-Driven Engineering: I don't just store data; I process it. Using Pandas & Numpy, I turn raw inputs into actionable business insights.<br>
    Hybrid Scraping Strategy: I can bypass complex bot protections using a mix of Scrapy for speed and Selenium/Playwright for dynamic JS content.<br>
    Full Cycle Delivery: From database design and Docker containerization to CI/CD deployment—I handle the entire pipeline.<br>
🛠 Technical Expertise:<br>
    Backend Core: Python (Asyncio), Django, DRF, FastAPI.<br>
    Data Extraction (ETL): Scrapy, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, lxml.<br>
    Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (Data Cleaning & Statistical Analysis).<br>
    Frontend & UI: React.js (Vite), TailwindCSS, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5.<br>
    Real-time & Microservices: Node.js (Socket.io), Redis (Pub/Sub & Caching), Celery.<br>
    DevOps & Tools: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, Git, GitHub Actions.<br>
🌟 What I can build for you:<br>
    Data Mining Platforms: Automated scrapers that collect data from thousands of pages, clean it with Pandas, and store it in PostgreSQL/MongoDB.<br>
    Real-Time Analytics Dashboards: Visualizing trends using React.js charts backed by Node.js WebSockets.<br>
    SaaS MVP: Complete web apps with user auth, payments, and admin panels.<br>
    High-Load APIs: Documented with Swagger/OpenAPI, optimized with Redis caching.
