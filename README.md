🚀 I build fast, scalable, and crash-proof web applications. <br>
As a Full Stack Python Developer with a professional background in QA Automation, I don't just write code that "works"—I write code that lasts. I specialize in building high-performance backends using FastAPI (Asyncio) and robust web applications with Django, paired with modern, responsive frontends using TailwindCSS.<br>
If you need an MVP built from scratch or a complex API optimized for high loads—I am your guy.<br>
💎 Why clients choose me:<br>
    The "QA Mindset": My background in testing means fewer bugs in production. I write clean code covered by Pytest, so you don't waste budget on endless fixes.<br>
    Modern Python Stack: I use the latest tools (Pydantic, Loguru, Httpx) to ensure your app is fast and maintainable.<br>
    Full Cycle Delivery: From database design to Docker containerization and CI/CD deployment—I handle the entire pipeline.<br>
🛠 Technical Expertise:<br>
    Backend Core: Python (Asyncio), Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), FastAPI.<br>
    Data & Performance: SQL (PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB), Redis (Caching), Celery (Background Tasks).<br>
    Real-time: WebSockets for live notifications and chat features.<br>
    Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, TailwindCSS, JavaScript (creating clean, responsive UIs directly within Django/FastAPI templates).<br>
    DevOps & Tools: Docker, Git, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Nginx.<br>
🌟 What I can build for you:<br>
    SaaS MVP: Complete web apps with user auth, payments, and dashboards.<br>
    REST APIs: Documented with Swagger/OpenAPI, ready for mobile or frontend integration.<br>
    Async Microservices: Using FastAPI and Redis for high-load processing.<br>
